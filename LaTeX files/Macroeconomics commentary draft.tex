        In response to the global financial crisis in 2008, China rolled out a massive 4 trillion yuan(US\$564 billion) stimulus package.
        \bigbreak
        With the coronavirus posing an even greater threat to the economy, the outbreak left the top leadership with a decision to make, as the efforts in 2008 also left the nation with a mountain of debt.
        \bigbreak
        Before the outbreak, China had already cut the top tier of the value-added tax(VAT) rate to 13 per cent from 16 per cent in April 2019, after a one percentage point cut in 2018. It had also raised the personal income tax threshold by 1,500 yuan(US\$211) to 5,000 yuan(US\$705) in January 2019, while allowing more pre-tax deduction in terms of child care, elderly care, medical expenditure, mortgage interest rates and continued learning. The total tax cuts amounted to 2.3 trillion yuan(US\$324 billion) in 2019.
        \bigbreak
        These moves were largely in response to the trade war with the United States, which led China’s economy last year to slow to a growth rate of 6.1 per cent, the slowest rate since political turmoil ravaged the country in 1990.
        \bigbreak
        Here, we track China’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, which emerged just as those trade war tensions with the US appeared to have cooled with the signing of the phase one deal in January.

            \bigbreak
            People’s Bank of China(PBOC) cuts banks’ reserve ratio requirement(RRR) by 0.5 percentage points. The RRR – the money that banks are required to hold in reserve – for big banks is lowered to 12.5 per cent, while the ratio for small and medium-sized banks is reduced to 10.5 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.

        The effect of COVID-19 has been rather drastic on China's economy, and as such, equally drastic measures have been implemented and discussed below, to combat the economic effect of COVID-19.

                \caption{Narayanan, Adithya. \textit{Effect of COVID-19 on the Chinese economy in the first quarter of 2020}}
            \end{figure}
            
            The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in lower consumer expenditure, investment by firms and net exports. Reduction in consumption can be attributed to reductions in disposable income as individuals are forced to take wageless leave or become unemployed, caused by lower derived demand for labour from lower consumer expenditure. Reductions in investment occur as firms face reduced demand, also resulting in lower net exports. As such, the Aggregate Demand(AD), defined as ``the total spending(real output or real GDP) on goods and services during a period of time at different possible price levels, ceteris paribus"(Tragakes), of the Chinese economy witnessed a shrinkage of ``6.8\%" in quarter 1 of 2020. AD is calculated using the following:
            \vspace{-0.5mm}
            \begin{equation}
                AD \ = \ Consumption \ + \ Investment \ + \ Government \ expenditure \ + \ (Exports \ - \ Imports)
            \end{equation}
            
            A leftward shift of AD, from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$, caused a reduction in the total output of the economy from 2.8 to 2.6 trillion and a reduction in price level of the economy, from $Pl_e$ to $Pl_2$. Aggregate Supply(AS), ``the total amount of goods and services that all firms in all industries produce in an economy(real GDP) over a particular period of time at different price levels, ceteris paribus''(Tragakes), shifted left from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$, mostly attributable to greater than usual death rates as a result of the pandemic, representative of a reduction in the productive capacity of the economy, due to a shrinkage of the labour force.

        \subsection{Policies implemented to assist the general economy:}
           The reductions in the Reserve-Requirement-Ratio(RRR), Loan-Prime-Rates(LPR), benchmark interest rates and Medium-Term-Lending-Facility(MLF) loans, as part of monetary policy attempts to reduce the cost of borrowing, incentivize consumption and investment, by increasing the disposable income of consumers and the funds available to be used for investment for firms, thus increasing AD, with investments creating injections into the circular flow of income(See Fig.2).

            Increases in fiscal expenditure, injections of 3 trillion Yuan, via monetary policies such as quantitative easing, and increases in business lending by 800 billion Yuan, part of the fiscal policy that the Chinese government has implemented, aims at increasing G. An eventual multiplier effect, ``a Keynesian theory that suggests a change in initial gov’t spending(G) will eventually have a greater(multiplied) effect on aggregate demand(AD), and hence on real GDP''(Ashton), on the economy is likely to occur, allowing the economy to exit the recession that is likely to occur in the short run, with the likely effect being an inflationary gap in the long run.
        \subsection{Policies implemented to assist firms:}
            The suspension of requirements to pay the civil aviation development fund assists the aviation industry, due to strict travel restrictions reducing demand, and as such the revenues and profits of aviation firms. Reductions in electricity prices for firms by 5\% assists in reducing a major cost of production for firms, thus assisting them. Allowing firms to halt pension fund payments for employees reduces a fixed cost that firms have to pay. Allowing loan repayments to be postponed reduces the short term burden on firms, however may increase the amount that will need to be paid in the long term. The implementation of such policies helps firms cope with the current situation.
        \subsection{Policies implemented to boost consumer confidence and expenditure:}
            The exemption of industries such as transport from Value-Added-Taxes(VAT), increases the disposable income left for consumers. As consumers face a greater tax burden due to inelastic demand, the removal of VAT assists consumers more than firms. Greater disposable income would likely encourage expenditure for other goods and services. The distribution of 300 million Yuan worth of vouchers assists consumers who may be struggling to meet their needs or to in general boost consumer expenditure, by increasing consumer disposable income. Aimed at specifically those struggling to meet needs, the doubling of temporary monthly allowance for low-income families ensures those who are struggling to meet their needs are assisted. The provision of unemployment benefits to vulnerable migrant workers allows the Chinese economy to assist likely frictionally unemployed individuals over the duration of the pandemic.
        \subsection{Policies intended to halt the spread of COVID-19:}
            The construction of temporary hospitals for COVID-19, assists to front line medical staff and most importantly the lockdowns are methods by which the government is halting the spread of COVID-19, in order to allow the economy to tackle the root cause of this issue. Direct resolution of this issue would assist in a quick recovery for the economy,as halting the spread of the virus would reduce. As such measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the labour force is the best way to ensure the shrinkage in the productive capacity of the economy remains minimal.
        \subsection{Conclusion:}
            The implementation of various policies assist different stakeholders with coping with the situation and their effectiveness can clearly be observed as China slowly recovers from the pandemic, as such the validity of economic theory is observed here with the policies implemented being effective.
