	\section{Introduction}
	Tax systems play a crucial role in economies and can be manipulated by governments for the purpose of achieving macroeconomic aims. Tax systems determine the budget of a government and remains the main source of revenue for governments around the world. However, different tax systems can engender different effects on an economy.
	\section{Fiscal policy}
	The Fiscal policy is a defined as "Manipulations by the government of its own expenditures and taxes in order to influence the level of aggregate demand; it is a type of demand- side policy or demand management"(Tragakes 544). This is achieved by influencing the components of AD thus curbing or stimulating the economy.
	\newline
	
	In expansionary fiscal policies, government spending may be increased, while taxes(T) may be decreased(See Fig.1). These shift the AD curve to the right(See Fig.2), allowing the economy to approach full employment of resources. The end result is an increase in Real GDP from $ Y_{rec} $ to $ Y_{p} $, hence used where a government needs to stimulate an economy(during recessions).

		Contractionary policies have the inverse effect on an economy. When an economy experiences an inflationary gap, governments may increase taxes and decrease expenditures, to shift the AD curve to the left and is used to achieve the aim of maintaining low inflation.

	\section{Tax systems:}
	\subsection{Progressive:}
	The term progressive tax system is used to indicate that "high-income earners [are taxed] proportionately more than low-income earners"(Poh). As income increases, the proportion taken in tax also rises. "The rationale is that people with a lower income will usually spend a greater percentage of their income to maintain their standard of living."(Investopedia).
	\newline
	
	The term progressive may also be used to describe the degree by which the proportion of income taken as tax increases as income increases, hence used to compare relative differences between progressive systems.
	
	\subsection{Regressive:}
	In regressive tax systems, those with lower incomes are taxed proportionately more than those with higher incomes, the inverse of progressive tax systems. As income increases, the proportion taxed decreases.
	
	\subsection{Proportional direct:}
	In Proportional direct or flat tax systems, the proportion of income taken as tax is unchanged, regardless of income.
	\newpage
	\section{Singapore}
	\subsection{Income tax:}
	Income tax in Singapore for tax residents in each financial year(FA) is progressive(See Fig.3). Tax residents are individuals who have stayed or worked in Singapore for a minimum 183 days in a year, or "for a period straddling two calendar years and ... total period of stay is at least 183 days"(Inland Revenue authority of Singapore). Individuals who are public entertainers, professionals or directors of a company as these individuals are classified as non-tax residents regardless. Taxable income sources include income earned in Singapore and "foreign-sourced income that was brought into Singapore prior to 1 Jan 2004"(Inland Revenue authority of Singapore); income brought into Singapore following 1 Jan 2004 is exempt from taxation.
	\newline
	
	Non-tax residents are charged a flat 15\% (See Fig.4) or progressive tax, depending on which method of taxation results in higher tax paid, which is calculated to be an income above S\$369,286. Disposable income is calculated using:
	
	\begin{equation}
	Disposable \ yearly \ income = Yearly \ income - Gross \ payable \ tax
	\end{equation}

		\subsection{Direct taxes:}
		\subsubsection{Corporate tax:}
		Singapore imposes flat corporate taxes on tax resident firms' profits up till S\$300,000 of 8.5\%. Profits above S\$300,000 are charged 17\%. No tax is charged on capital gains, dividend distribution amongst shareholders and foreign sourced income not brought into Singapore for corporations.
		\newline
		
		Firms do not have to incur double payments in 76 countries that have signed "Avoidance of Double taxation Agreements(DTAs)"(Inland revenue authority of Singapore).
		
		
		\subsection{Indirect taxes:}
		\subsubsection{Government service tax:}
		A flat 7\% is charged on all goods and services sold in Singapore(Ministry of Finance). Although this is a flat rate, it can also be considered regressive, as individuals with lower incomes would be spending a higher proportion of their income, than those with higher incomes. Real estate sales, supply and investment of precious metals, financial services, exports of goods and international services, and financial services are all exempt from GST and are zero rated.
		
		\subsubsection{Excise duties:}
		Goods and services are taxed under 4 different categories, with varying subcategories. Taxes for each unit of a good that falls in one of the above categories is calculated using specific formulas(See Fig.5). Excise duty rates(EDRs) refer to over 509 percentage values set by the government for different types of goods.

\section{Russia:}
\subsection{Income tax:}
Income tax in Russia is a flat 13\% for tax residents(See Fig.3) and 30\%(See Fig.4) for non-tax residents on total income. Tax residents in Russia consists of individuals that "are physically present in Russia for 183 days in any 12 month consecutive period"(Withers)or those who possess a home in Russia.  Dividend income tax is a flat 9\% for residents and 15\% for non-residents. 
\newline

Non-residents can also be made exempt from a flat tax of 30\% if granted migration status as a highly qualified specialist and can be charged the resident tax rate. Disposable income is calculated using:
\begin{equation}
Disposable \ income = Yearly \ income \times(1 - Income \ tax \ rate)
\end{equation}

		\subsection{Direct taxes:}
		\subsubsection{Capital gains tax:}
		Capital gains tax in Russia for non-residents is charged at a flat tax rate of 20\%. Taxable income in Russia is the actual selling price of the good itself, before subtractions for purchasing costs.
		\subsubsection{Corporate tax:}
		The maximum corporate tax(CIT) in Russia is set at a flat 20\%; 3\% of goes to the national government while 17\% goes to regional governments, who have the authority to lower this to 13.5\%. Companies are subject to capital gains taxes of 20\% and are charged with withholding taxes. "Russian companies pay 9\% tax on dividends and 15\% when they are received by international companies."(Expatica). Firms operating in nations who posses no tax treaty with Russia are charged 20\% on royalties. "Companies with income of around 567,000 p. are subject to 30\% social contribution tax. If the profit exceeds this amount, they pay 10\% more[on the excess]"(Expatica).
		\newline
		
		Non-resident corporations are charged with a flat withholding tax of 20\%. Income received from international transport is taxed at 10\%. 
		\subsection{Indirect  taxes:}
		\subsubsection{Value Added Tax(VAT):}
		Russia imposes a benchmark 20\% VAT on all goods and services, with a "reduced rate of 10\% for certain food products, medical appliances, pharmaceuticals, educational, cultural and scientific materials and children’s products"(Pagero). Enterprise sales and foreign providers of e-services are have a flat VAT rate of 16.67\%. Goods identified by the Russian government to be necessities, for e.g. the Russian suburban rail transport system, exports and associated services have no VAT applied until 2029. 
		\subsubsection{Property tax:}
		Property tax in Russia is based on value of the property and can be placed at a maximum rate of 2\%

		\section{Evaluating tax systems:}
		\subsection{Direct taxes:}
		\subsubsection{Income tax:}
		Assuming a highly simplified hypothetical scenario(as an evaluation metric for equity in income taxes paid between above-mentioned tax systems) amongst 2 fictional individuals classified as tax residents, A and B, with A having a low income per annum of US\$10,000 and B having a high income per annum relative to A, of US\$300,000, it can be observed in Singapore that A would pay US\$0 in taxes while B would pay US\$91301.01. In Russia, A would be subject to a tax of US\$1,300 while B would be required to pay US\$39,000 in taxes.
		\newline
		
		In Singapore, A would have a disposable income of US\$10,000, while B would have a disposable income of US\$208,682.79. In Russia, A would have a disposable income of US\$8,700, while B would have a disposable income of US\$261,000.
		\newline
		
		It is evident that A has a higher disposable income in Singapore, illustrating that less burden is placed on A in Singapore, hence allowing for the equitable distribution of income. Having lower taxes for B would result in larger proportions of income being spent on Giffen/positional goods, that create an opportunity cost for possible expenditures by the government that could improve social well-being, such as transfer payments, if to be taxed in Singapore. The Singapore tax system also provides more revenue for the government.
		\newline
		
		It can be argued, however that progressive systems tax the rich unfairly.
		\newline
		
		Overall, it can be observed that Singapore has a more equitable income tax system, relative to Russia.
		
		\subsubsection{Corporate tax:}
		
		In order to make Singapore more attractable to Multinational Corporations(MNCs), corporate taxes were cut, with no capital gains tax being imposed, while Russia imposes a flat tax on nearly all corporations. Hence, it can be argued that many individuals receive higher incomes overall in Singapore, hence not being as significantly affected by the Singaporean income tax system. However, these effects would be minimal and is observed when comparing the Gini coefficient of both nations, with Singapore having a score of 0.458 and Russia having a aimilar score of 0.412.
		
		\subsection{Indirect taxes:}
		\subsubsection{GST/VAT:}
		Looking at indirect taxes, it can be argued that GST in Singapore is more equitable than the VAT in Russia. The lower GST in Singapore may encourage the consumption of goods and services and help boost national output. On the other hand, it can be argued that the higher VAT in Russia has minimal effect on consumption, due to the lower value of the Russian Ruble relative to the SGD.
		\newline
		
		\section{Conclusion}
		It can be evidently observed that between the 2 nations, varying disadvantages and advantages between tax system utilisation, exist between the 2 nations. From the analysis of the numerous advantages that the income tax system in Singapore has over Russia, to why corporation tax in Russia triumphs in equality, over Singapore, it can be seen that neither of the 2 nations excel over the other as having the best tax system, rather each have their own advantages over the other in differing aspects of the tax system.

	\section{Reflection}
		Over the course of this project I learnt to utilize a variety of source to analysew a variety of concepts. If I were to do this project again, I would most definitely follow the same process as I felt it had assisted me in achieving the goals I intended to achieve. I overall feel this project went very well.
	\section{Source Evaluation}
		Following are 2 sources analysed using the OPVL method.
		\subsection{IRAS:}
			\textbf{Source:}
			\newline
			Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. “Income Tax Rates - IRAS.” \textit{Iras.Gov.Sg}, 2019, www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/. Accessed 9 Sept. 2019.
			\newline
			
			\textbf{Origin}
			\newline
			This source is a website originating from the Singaporean government and was updated in 2019 for the new YA. This is a secondary source as the information was provided from an external source, the Singapore government. The author is an individual authorised by the Singaporean government to update the website. This website was published by the Singaporean government on a  government website. As this website was published in 2019, the information provided can be determined to be recent and most likely, accurate, with an extremely small margin of error. The Singapore government is a credible source, as the information provided comes directly from the judicial authority(which here is the Singapore government), which would ensure that the information provided is accurate as the government has no intention to provide false information, as doing so would first of all create  public mistrust for misinformation towards the government, and it is also important to note that giving false information for the tax that needs to be paid would affect government revenue, hence would not be of interest to the government.  
			\newline
		
		
			\textbf{Purpose:}
			\newline
			The purpose of this source is to provide information regarding the amount of tax that an individual would need to pay to the Singapore government, if it were necessary to do so.  It is evident that this is geared towards individuals who may need to calculate the amount of tax that they need to pay as either a tax resident or non-tax resident to Singapore. It can also be observed that this website is geared towards audiences who may also intend to find out if they are required ot pay any tax in the first place, and allow them to evaluate if they would liable to paying tax in Singapore or not. This website was created with the intent of educating individuals who may have doubts regarding the payment of taxes in Singapore. The website was created to ensure that the tax maintains the certainty principle of a good tax, and the payments that need to be made in tax are made clear to individuals who have to pay tax in Singapore. This website may also act as clarification for individuals who may notice an unusual pattern in the tax that they need to pay to the Singapore government. This can also act as a mechanism for the government to recognise possible errors that they may have when requiring the payment of taxes and correct this, as individuals begin to double check the amount of tax that they may be entitled to pay. The website also provides a framework to contact support for taxes and acts as a platform for the government to address any questions that people may have. There is no bias in the information provided, rather it is just a statement of facts clarifying how the tax system in Singapore functions. The author chose to create this document in an unbiased manner in order ot ensure that there is clarity in the information provided, thus also assisting the government in ensuring that the tax system is a good tax system that attempts to excel at the 7 principles of a good tax.There is no propaganda here, and information is provided in a straight to the point manner.

			\textbf{Value:}	
			\newline
			This source was of great value to me when writing my report as it provided me with all the information that I needed upfront. It was not only condensed, but also very informative as it provided me with the information that I needed. This source provides information for the income tax table that I had created above, in my report, and was crucial to my report. I felt that this was one of the most valuable sources that I had used over the course of this report, as the information it provided, was not only extremely accurate, but also from the most trusted source that I could receive my information from, which was directly from those who charge taxes, the IRAS. I found great value in the fact that the information was highly condensed, straight to the point and was relatively easy to extract the information that I needed from the source. I felt that as the website was not made, in my opinion, with any bias, the information did not influence my writing.
			\newline
			
			
			\textbf{Limitations:}
			\newline
			The reliability of the source is not an issue and was not a limitation, however, a lack of detailed explanations to illustrate the reasoning behind some decisions made, unlike news sources, made it confusing at points to comprehend why certain choices in the tax system was made. I felt that rather than needing to visit other website and news sources to find this information, rather than receiving this information directly from this source, would be far more reliable, as it comes directly from the authority that enforces taxes, and would ensure that the information that I collect can be backed up by the source that provided it. However, without any reasoning behind choices regarding the tax system, it can be observed that the lack of any explanation from the perspective of the government, may make some choices seem unreasonable. However, only after visiting other sources, the reasoning behind multiple choices was made evident and I could understand the government's perspective. Considering that this is a government website, it may have been best for the government to justify the reasoning behind their choices. However this would not be necessary as it would take away from the formality of the source and may be considered as biased.
		\subsection{Investopedia - "What is Fiscal policy?":}
			\textbf{Source:}
			\newline
			Kramer, Leslie. “What Is Fiscal Policy?” \textit{Investopedia}, 2019, www.investopedia.com/insight-
			-s/what-is-fiscal-policy/. Accessed 9 Sept. 2019.
			\newline
			
			\textbf{Origin}
			\newline
			This source is an online website that aims to improve financial education amongst those lacking it and provide clarifications on doubts that individuals may have. Investopedia is a source that aims to improve kn financial knowledge and aims to "empower every person to feel in control of their financial future"(Investopedia). This specific article was written by Leslie Kramer. Ms.Kramer has over 10 years of experience in "writing financial and investment news"(Investopedia). Ms. Kramer has written for many other recognized sources, such as CNBC. She has been a part of Investopedia for over 5 years now. Ms.Kramer has a "Bachelor of Arts in English literature from Washington University in St. Louis"(Investopedia) and a "Master of Fine Arts in theatre from [the] Yale School of Drama"(Investopedia). She is also a special correspondent at CNBC. I believe these credentials make this author reliable.
			\newline
			
			The information from this source was last updated in May 8, 2019. This is a secondary source. 
			\newline
			
			\textbf{Purpose:}
			\newline
			The purpose of this source is to improve financial literacy amongst individuals seeking to improve their knowledge. This article is clearly targeted at individuals who are novices when it comes to financial topics. The author here is trying to convey information regarding Fiscal policies and how they are manipulated and utilised by governments. The information provided is presented in a factual format, from third person point of view (to maintain a formal tone) and does not show any bias towards any particular individual, political party or other groups/individuals. The purpose for this source is clear. The source appears to be very objective, and simplified to a format where information is straight to the point. The author created this piece of work, as mentioned above, in order to boost the financial and economic literacy of individuals who choose to read it. 
			\newline
			‌
			
			\textbf{Value:}	
			\newline
			This source proved to be of great value to my report and provided me with crucial information that was needed to explain information in a manner that was not only straight ot the point, hence assisting my explanation, but also relatively clear. The source also assisted my method of explanation and how i had broken down information and explained it. One great thing about this source was that it wsa rather clear, hence allowing me to extract the information that I needed as quickly as possible and as clearly as possible. Another great thing about this source is that it was written by an experienced individual, hence not only being likely very accurate, but also reliable.
			\newline
			
			
			\textbf{Limitations:}
			\newline
			The reliability of this source, like the source above, was not a major issue with his source. One limitation I felt with this source was the fact that due to the extremely objective approach, there was a lack of exaples. Some examples could have clarified the point that the author was trying to get across. Some terminologies could have also been better defined, however, it can be argued that the use of hyperlinks to articles explaining the meaning of a particular subject in detail, would suffice. There is very minimal bias, however, it should be noted, that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate biases out of an article completely as this would require that each article be reviewed by an experienced professional, who may not always be available.
